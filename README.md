For this project I downloaded all of my personal strava data - partly in a bid to prove I don't need to pay Â£55 a year for Strava Premium's analytics.
The download was a zip file, I named skye_strava_data, and includes information on activities, friends, giving kudos, any uploaded images, and much more. 
The activities file included a gpx file for each of my activities, which necessitated any geo-spatial data analysis I made.
